Install instructions on Windows:
Bring up command pallet (ctrl + shift + p in VSCode) or type in source and then the path to the Python in the venv
Use existing venv for Python
Test this using 'which python' checking to see that the path leads to the repository path
Use poetry add to add dependencies for the venv to run the Python app

# Python Packages needed:

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
